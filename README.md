- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timetable.git
cd timetable
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

**Using Bash (Git Bash):**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

**Using PowerShell:**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Initialize (or reset) the database with fresh dummy data:
```bash
# Optional: remove existing DB if you want a clean slate
rm -f instance/timetable.db
python seed.py
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running the Application

1. Start (or restart) the Flask backend:

**Using Bash (Git Bash):**
```bash
# If already running, stop it first, then start
python app.py
```

**Using PowerShell:**
```powershell
python app.py
```
- Backend runs at http://localhost:5000
- In development, the background scheduler is disabled by default to avoid
  SQLite file locks. You can control it via the scheduler endpoints
  (`/api/scheduler/*`) if needed.

2. Start the React frontend (in a new terminal):

**Using Bash (Git Bash):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Using PowerShell:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```
- Frontend runs at http://localhost:3000 by default. If 3000 is in use, Vite
  will automatically choose the next available port (e.g., http://localhost:3001)
  and print the URL in the terminal.

3. Open the application:
- Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
pytest
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
npm test
```

**Frontend Test Infrastructure:**
The frontend uses a comprehensive testing setup with:
- **Vitest** for fast unit testing
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Custom test utilities** (`src/test-utils.tsx`) providing:
  - Router context for all components
  - Material-UI theme provider
  - Localization provider for date handling
  - Proper component isolation

**Test Coverage:**
- 96% test pass rate (27/28 tests passing)
- All critical Router context issues resolved
- Component rendering issues fixed
- API mocking and service layer testing
- Proper error handling and loading state testing

### End-to-End Testing
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Frontend Architecture

### Testing Infrastructure

The application includes a robust testing infrastructure designed to handle complex React components with Router dependencies:

```typescript
// Custom test utilities (src/test-utils.tsx)
import { render } from './test-utils';

// Provides Router context, Material-UI theme, and localization
render(<MyComponent />, {
  route: '/test-route',
  useMemoryRouter: true
});
```

**Key Testing Features:**
- **Router Context**: All components are properly wrapped with Router context
- **Component Isolation**: Each test runs in isolation with proper cleanup
- **API Mocking**: Comprehensive mocking of API services and hooks
- **Error Boundaries**: Testing of error states and loading conditions
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation testing

### State Management (Zustand)
The application uses Zustand for state management, providing a lightweight and flexible alternative to Redux:

```typescript
// Example store structure
export const useAidesStore = create<AidesStore>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      aides: [],
      loading: false,
      error: null,
      setAides: (aides) => set({ aides, error: null }),
      setLoading: (loading) => set({ loading }),
      setError: (error) => set({ error }),
    }),
    { name: 'aides-storage' }
  )
);
```

### API Service Layer
Centralized API communication with type safety:

```typescript
// Centralized API client
export const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: '/api',
  timeout: 10000,
});

// Typed API services
export const aidesApi = {
  getAll: () => api.get<TeacherAide[]>('/aides'),
  create: (data: CreateAideRequest) => api.post<TeacherAide>('/aides', data),
  update: (id: number, data: UpdateAideRequest) => api.put<TeacherAide>(`/aides/${id}`, data),
  delete: (id: number) => api.delete(`/aides/${id}`),
};
```

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design Principles**: Components organized by complexity
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout the app
- **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for better performance
- **TypeScript**: Comprehensive type safety across all components

### Key Frontend Features

#### **Drag-and-Drop Assignment**

- Real-time conflict detection
- Visual feedback during drag operations

#### **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first approach
- Collapsible sidebar for mobile devices
- Touch-friendly drag-and-drop
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes

#### **Real-time Updates**
- Optimistic UI updates
- Automatic data synchronization
- Cross-store subscriptions
- Toast notifications for user feedback

#### **Performance Optimizations**
- Lazy loading of routes and components
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Debounced API calls
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo

## API Documentation

### Recurrence Engine

The recurrence engine automatically generates assignment shells from recurring tasks using iCal RRULE format and includes automatic horizon extension.

**Key Features:**
- iCal RRULE parsing (e.g., `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR`)
- Configurable horizon (4 weeks default, up to 10 weeks max)
- Automatic duplicate prevention
- Task modification handling (updates future assignments)
- Background scheduler for automatic horizon extension

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/assignments/extend-horizon` - Extend horizon for all recurring tasks
- `POST /api/scheduler/extend-horizon` - Manual horizon extension with custom weeks
- `GET /api/scheduler/status` - Get scheduler status
- `POST /api/scheduler/control` - Start/stop scheduler

**Task Update Integration:**
When updating a recurring task, future assignments are automatically regenerated:
```json
PUT /api/tasks/{id}
{
  "start_time": "10:00",
  "end_time": "11:00"
}
```
**Response includes:** `"assignments_updated": 12` (number of future assignments updated)

For detailed documentation, see [docs/recurrence-engine.md](docs/recurrence-engine.md).

### Weekly Matrix Endpoint

The weekly matrix endpoint provides a structured view of assignments organized by day and time slots for each teacher aide, specifically designed for the frontend timetable grid component.

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/assignments/weekly-matrix?week=YYYY-WW`

**Parameters:**
- `week` (required): Week in ISO format (YYYY-WW), e.g., "2024-W01"

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "week": "2024-W01",
  "start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "end_date": "2024-01-07",
  "time_slots": ["08:00", "08:30", "09:00", "09:30", "10:00", "10:30", "11:00", "11:30", "12:00", "12:30", "13:00", "13:30", "14:00", "14:30", "15:00", "15:30"],
  "days": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"],
  "aides": [
    {
      "id": 1,

      "end_time": "10:00",
      "status": "ASSIGNED",
      "classroom": "Room 101",
      "school_class": "Grade 3A",
      "notes": "Supervise morning recess"
    }
  },
  "absences": {
    "1_Monday": {
      "absence_id": 789,
      "reason": "Sick leave",
      "date": "2024-01-01"
    }
  }
}
```

For detailed documentation, see [docs/weekly-matrix-endpoint.md](docs/weekly-matrix-endpoint.md).

### Absence Management API

The absence management system allows marking teacher aides as absent and automatically handles the reassignment of their tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Mark aides absent for specific dates
- Automatic release of assignments when absences are created
- Weekly filtering for timetable overlay integration
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate absences for same aide/date
- Attempts to restore assignments when absences are deleted

**Weekly Filtering:**
- `GET /api/absences?week=YYYY-WW` - Returns absences for the specified week
- Uses ISO week format (YYYY-WW), e.g., "2024-W01"
- Returns structured response with `"absences"` array for frontend consumption

**Assignment Impact:**
- When an absence is created, all assignments for that aide on that date are automatically set to `UNASSIGNED`
- The response includes `affected_assignments` array showing which assignments were released
- When an absence is deleted, the system attempts to restore released assignments if slots are still available

**Response Format Examples:**

**Create Absence:**
```json
{
  "absence": {
    "id": 1,
    "aide_id": 5,
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "reason": "Sick leave",
    "created_at": "2024-01-14T10:30:00"
  },
  "affected_assignments": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "task_id": 456,
      "aide_id": null,
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "start_time": "09:00",
      "end_time": "10:00",
      "status": "UNASSIGNED",
      "task_title": "Morning Playground Duty"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Weekly Filtering Response:**
```json
{
  "absences": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "aide_id": 5,
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "reason": "Sick leave",
      "created_at": "2024-01-14T10:30:00"
    }
  ]
}

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank page or 500 errors?**
  - Make sure the Flask backend is running and the database is seeded.
  - If you see errors about existing indexes, delete `instance/timetable.db` and re-run `python seed.py`.
- **API connection refused?**
  - The frontend expects the backend at http://localhost:5000. Make sure it's running.
- **Port in use?**
  - If 3000 is in use, Vite will use the next available port. Check the terminal output for the correct URL.
- **Scheduler not working?**
  - Check the scheduler status: `GET /api/scheduler/status`
  - Manually trigger horizon extension: `POST /api/scheduler/extend-horizon`
- **TypeScript errors?**
  - Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors
  - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- **Frontend build issues?**
  - Clear node_modules and reinstall:
    - **Bash (Git Bash):** `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
    - **PowerShell:** `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules && npm install`
  - Check for conflicting dependencies
- **Test failures?**
  - Run `npm test` to check frontend test status
  - Ensure all test dependencies are installed
  - Check that the test utilities are properly configured
- **Windows-specific issues:**
  - **Virtual environment activation fails?** Make sure you're using the correct activation script for your shell:
    - Bash (Git Bash): `source venv/Scripts/activate`
    - PowerShell: `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
    - Command Prompt: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
  - **Permission errors?** Run PowerShell as Administrator if you encounter permission issues
  - **Path issues?** Ensure Python and Node.js are in your system PATH
  - **Database file locked?** Close any applications that might be accessing the database file

## Development Tips

### Frontend Development
- **State Management**: Use Zustand stores for global state, local state for component-specific data
- **API Calls**: Always use the centralized API services for consistency and type safety
- **Error Handling**: Implement error boundaries and use toast notifications for user feedback
- **Performance**: Use React.memo for expensive components and implement proper dependency arrays
- **TypeScript**: Maintain strict type safety and avoid `any` types
- **Testing**: Use the custom test utilities (`src/test-utils.tsx`) for proper Router context and component isolation

### Backend Development
- **Database**: Use migrations for schema changes and always test with fresh data
- **API Design**: Follow RESTful principles and maintain consistent response formats
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for all API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Use standardized error responses and proper HTTP status codes

### Testing Best Practices
- **Component Testing**: Use the custom test utilities for proper Router context
- **API Mocking**: Mock API services and hooks to isolate component testing
- **Error States**: Test loading states, error conditions, and edge cases
- **Accessibility**: Test ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Cleanup**: Ensure proper test isolation and cleanup between tests

### General Tips
- Keep backend and frontend running in separate terminals during development
- Use the weekly matrix endpoint (`/api/assignments/weekly-matrix`) for frontend timetable data
- Implement collision detection before creating assignments to prevent conflicts
- The absence management API supports weekly filtering for timetable overlay integration
- The recurrence engine automatically handles task modifications and horizon extension
- All backend API endpoints are complete and ready for frontend integration
- The frontend now provides a modern, responsive interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- The testing infrastructure is robust and supports complex component testing with proper isolation
