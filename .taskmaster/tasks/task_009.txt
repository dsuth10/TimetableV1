# Task ID: 9
# Title: Recurrence Engine Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the recurrence engine for generating assignment shells from recurring tasks.
# Details:
1. Implement recurrence engine using dateutil.rrule:
   - Parse iCal RRULE format (e.g., FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR)
   - Generate dates based on the rule and expiration date
   - Create assignment shells for the next 4 weeks (configurable to full 10-week term)
2. Create a function to extend the assignment horizon:
   - Identify recurring tasks that need more future assignments
   - Generate additional assignments up to the configured horizon
3. Implement a scheduled task or endpoint to trigger horizon extension
4. Handle modifications to recurring tasks:
   - Update future unstarted assignments when task details change
   - Keep historical assignments unchanged

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test RRULE parsing with various patterns
2. Test assignment shell generation for different recurrence patterns
3. Test horizon extension logic
4. Verify modifications to recurring tasks update future assignments correctly
5. Test edge cases like tasks with immediate expiration
