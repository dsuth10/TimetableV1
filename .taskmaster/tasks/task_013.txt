# Task ID: 13
# Title: Drag and Drop Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement drag and drop functionality for assigning tasks to aides and handling conflicts.
# Details:
1. Set up React DnD library:
   - Define drag sources (task cards)
   - Define drop targets (timetable slots)
2. Implement drag behavior:
   - Visual feedback during drag
   - Validation of drop targets
   - Rejection animation for invalid drops
3. Implement drop handling:
   - Call assignment API on successful drop
   - Handle API responses
   - Show error messages for failures
4. Implement conflict detection:
   - Call collision check API before finalizing drop
   - Show conflict modal if collision detected
5. Implement drag between aides:
   - Allow reassigning tasks by dragging between aide columns
   - Apply same conflict rules

# Test Strategy:
1. Test dragging tasks from unassigned list to timetable
2. Test dragging tasks between aides
3. Verify conflict detection works correctly
4. Test invalid drops (e.g., onto absent aide)
5. Verify visual feedback during drag operations
6. Test keyboard accessibility for drag and drop
