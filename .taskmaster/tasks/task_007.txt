# Task ID: 7
# Title: Absence Management API Endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement API endpoints for marking aides as absent and handling the reassignment of their tasks.
# Details:
1. Create RESTful endpoints for absences:
   - POST /api/absences - Mark aide absent {aide_id, date, reason}
   - DELETE /api/absences/<id> - Remove absence (re-link tasks if possible)
   - GET /api/absences?week=YYYY-WW - List absences for timetable overlay
2. Implement absence logic:
   - When an absence is created, set all assignments for that aide and date to UNASSIGNED
   - When an absence is deleted, attempt to restore released assignments if slots are still free
3. Add unique constraint for (aide_id, date)
4. Return appropriate HTTP status codes (409 for duplicate absences)
5. Include released assignment IDs in the response

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each endpoint with valid and invalid data
2. Test absence creation and its effect on assignments
3. Test absence deletion and reassignment logic
4. Verify unique constraint works
5. Test edge cases (e.g., absence with no assignments, undo after reassignment)
6. Test weekly filtering for absences
