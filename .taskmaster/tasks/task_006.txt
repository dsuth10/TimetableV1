# Task ID: 6
# Title: Assignment API Endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement API endpoints for managing assignments, including collision detection and batch operations.
# Details:
1. Create RESTful endpoints for assignments:
   - GET /api/assignments?week=YYYY-WW - Get weekly matrix for UI
   - POST /api/assignments - Assign single occurrence
   - POST /api/assignments/batch - Assign many (recurring)
   - POST /api/assignments/check - Collision probe (dry-run)
   - PATCH /api/assignments/<id> - Update status or reassign
   - DELETE /api/assignments/<id> - Delete assignment
2. Implement collision detection logic:
   - Check if an aide is already assigned during the requested time
   - Return 409 Conflict with details of the collision
3. Implement batch assignment for recurring tasks
4. Add filtering by week
5. Return appropriate HTTP status codes

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each endpoint with valid and invalid data
2. Test collision detection with various scenarios
3. Test batch assignment with recurring patterns
4. Verify weekly filtering works correctly
5. Test status updates and reassignments
6. Benchmark collision check performance to ensure it meets the <150ms requirement
