# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Flask backend and React frontend structure. Set up necessary dependencies and development environment.
# Details:
1. Create a new project repository
2. Set up Flask backend structure:
   - Create app.py as entry point
   - Set up blueprints for API routes
   - Configure SQLite database connection
   - Install dependencies: Flask, Flask-RESTful, SQLAlchemy, dateutil
3. Set up React frontend structure:
   - Use Create React App or Vite
   - Install dependencies: React, React Router, React DnD (for drag and drop), date-fns
   - Set up folder structure (components, contexts, hooks, etc.)
4. Configure build process to bundle frontend into a single HTML file
5. Set up development environment with hot reloading
6. Create README with setup instructions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all dependencies install correctly
2. Ensure development server starts without errors
3. Confirm backend and frontend can communicate
4. Test that the application can run completely offline from a single HTML bundle and SQLite database file
