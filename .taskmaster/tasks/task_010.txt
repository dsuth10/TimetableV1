# Task ID: 10
# Title: Frontend React Setup and Routing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the React frontend with routing and global state management.
# Details:
1. Set up React Router with routes for:
   - Main schedule page
   - Aide management
   - Task management
   - Settings
2. Implement global state management using Context API or Redux:
   - Store for aides, tasks, assignments, absences
   - Loading and error states
3. Create API service layer for communicating with the backend
4. Implement authentication placeholder (for future enhancement)
5. Set up layout components:
   - Header with navigation
   - Main content area
   - Modals container

# Test Strategy:
1. Test routing between different pages
2. Verify global state updates correctly
3. Test API service layer with mock data
4. Ensure components receive and display state correctly
5. Test responsive layout on desktop screens
