   - Standard availability patterns for each aide (Monday-Friday, 8:00-16:00)
   - At least 3 classrooms with different capacities
   - 5 demo tasks of different categories (PLAYGROUND, CLASS_SUPPORT, GROUP_SUPPORT, INDIVIDUAL_SUPPORT)

   - One sample absence
2. Ensure seed data covers all entity types and relationships
3. Add command-line options to reset the database and re-seed
4. Include realistic data that demonstrates all features (recurring tasks, conflicts, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
