# Task ID: 14
# Title: Task Creation and Edit Modals
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement modals for creating and editing tasks, including recurrence options.
# Details:
1. Create task creation modal:
   - Form fields for all task properties
   - Validation for required fields
   - Category selection with visual indicators
   - Time selection with validation
   - Classroom selection dropdown
2. Implement recurrence options:
   - Toggle for one-off vs recurring
   - Weekday selection for recurring tasks
   - End date selection
   - Preview of generated occurrences
3. Create task edit modal:
   - Pre-populated form with existing task data
   - Warning about effects on future occurrences
4. Implement form validation:
   - Required fields
   - Time constraints (end > start, within school hours)
   - Valid recurrence pattern

# Test Strategy:
1. Test form validation with valid and invalid inputs
2. Verify recurrence options generate correct preview
3. Test task creation API integration
4. Test task editing and its effect on future occurrences
5. Verify modal opens and closes correctly
6. Test keyboard accessibility
