# Task ID: 2
# Title: Database Schema and Migrations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the database schema for all entities as specified in the PRD. Set up migration system using Alembic.
# Details:
1. Create SQLAlchemy models for all entities:
   - TeacherAide (id, name, qualifications, colour_hex)
   - Availability (id, aide_id, weekday, start_time, end_time)
   - Classroom (id, name, capacity, notes)
   - Task (id, title, category, start_time, end_time, recurrence_rule, expires_on, classroom_id, notes, status)
   - Assignment (id, task_id, aide_id, date, start_time, end_time, status)
   - Absence (id, aide_id, date, reason, created_at)
2. Define relationships between models:
   - TeacherAide has many Availability, Assignment, Absence
   - Task may belong to a Classroom
   - Task has many Assignment
   - Assignment links a Task to an aide
3. Set up Alembic for database migrations
4. Create initial migration script
5. Add unique constraints:
   - (aide_id, date) for Absence
   - Ensure assignments cannot overlap for a single aide
6. Implement database initialization script

# Test Strategy:
1. Run migrations to verify schema creation
2. Test model relationships with sample data
3. Verify constraints work as expected (e.g., cannot create duplicate absences)
4. Test database rollback and migration versioning
