# Progress: Teacher Aide Scheduler

## 1. What Works

*   **Task Management UI:** The basic UI for creating, editing, and deleting tasks is in place.
*   **Task Creation/Editing Modals:** The modals for creating and editing tasks are functional, though they have some issues that need to be resolved.
*   **API Integration:** The frontend is integrated with the backend API for fetching and creating tasks.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   **Task Deletion:** The task deletion functionality is partially implemented, but needs to be fully tested and verified.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Scheduling:** The drag-and-drop functionality for assigning tasks to aides has not yet been implemented.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** The conflict resolution modal has been created, but the logic for detecting and resolving conflicts needs to be implemented.
*   **Absence Management:** The absence management features, including marking aides as absent and handling their assignments, have not yet been implemented.
*   **Teacher Aide and Teacher Views:** The personalized views for teacher aides and the request form for teachers need to be implemented.

## 3. Current Status

The project is in the process of implementing the core task management features. The frontend has been refactored to use TypeScript, and the basic UI for task management is in place. However, there are several issues that need to be resolved before the task management features can be considered complete.

## 4. Known Issues

*   **`Grid` Component Error:** There is a persistent error with the Material-UI `Grid` component in `TaskManagement.tsx` that needs to be resolved.
*   **Incomplete TypeScript Conversion:** The conversion to TypeScript is not yet complete, and there are still some type-related errors that need to be addressed.
*   **API Error Handling:** The error handling for API requests is not yet fully implemented, and needs to be improved to provide better feedback to the user.
