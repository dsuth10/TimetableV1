# Product Context: Teacher Aide Scheduler

## 1. Problem Statement

School administrators currently spend a significant amount of time manually creating and managing schedules for teacher aides. This process is often done using spreadsheets or paper-based systems, which are prone to errors, difficult to update, and lack real-time visibility. Key challenges include:

*   **Inefficient Scheduling:** Manually assigning tasks is time-consuming and makes it difficult to optimize aide allocation.
*   **Scheduling Conflicts:** Double-booking aides or assigning them to tasks they are not qualified for is a common issue.
*   **Poor Communication:** Aides may not have a clear, up-to-date view of their schedules, leading to confusion and missed assignments.
*   **Difficulty Handling Absences:** When an aide is absent, reassigning their duties is a manual and stressful process.
*   **Lack of Data:** There is no easy way to track aide utilization, task distribution, or other key metrics.

## 2. Vision & Goals

The Teacher Aide Scheduler aims to solve these problems by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform for managing all aspects of teacher aide scheduling.

### Goals:

*   **Streamline the scheduling process:** Reduce the time and effort required to create and manage aide schedules.
*   **Improve communication:** Provide a single source of truth for all stakeholders (administrators, aides, and teachers).
*   **Increase efficiency:** Optimize the allocation of teacher aides to meet the needs of the school.
*   **Reduce errors:** Prevent scheduling conflicts and ensure that all duties are covered.
*   **Provide valuable insights:** Offer data and reporting to help administrators make informed decisions.

## 3. User Experience

The application should be intuitive and easy to use for all user roles. The primary user experience is centered around a visual, drag-and-drop timetable that provides a clear overview of the week's schedule. Key UX principles include:

*   **Clarity:** The interface should be clean and uncluttered, with a clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Efficiency:** Common tasks should be quick and easy to perform.
*   **Feedback:** The system should provide immediate feedback to user actions, such as highlighting scheduling conflicts.
*   **Accessibility:** The application should be accessible to users with disabilities.
