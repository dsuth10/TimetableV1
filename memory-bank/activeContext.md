# Active Context: Teacher Aide Scheduler

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing and verifying the remaining user stories, with a particular emphasis on the task management features. This includes:

*   **Task Creation:** Ensuring that both one-off and recurring tasks can be created successfully.
*   **Task Editing:** Ensuring that existing tasks can be edited, and that changes are correctly propagated to future assignments.
*   **Task Deletion:** Implementing the ability to delete tasks, with appropriate warnings about cascading effects.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   **Refactoring to TypeScript:** The `TaskManagement`, `TaskCreationModal`, and `TaskEditModal` components have been converted from `.jsx` to `.tsx` to improve type safety.
*   **`dayjs` Integration:** The `dayjs` library has been integrated for handling dates and times in the task modals.
*   **Validation:** The task form validation has been updated to use `dayjs` for time comparisons.
*   **Task Deletion API:** The `deleteTask` function has been added to `taskService.js` to handle task deletion.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Fix `Grid` Component:** Resolve the persistent issue with the Material-UI `Grid` component in `TaskManagement.tsx`.
2.  **Verify Task Management:** Thoroughly test the task creation, editing, and deletion features in the browser.
3.  **Implement Remaining User Stories:** Continue working through the remaining user stories, including:
    *   Drag-and-drop scheduling
    *   Absence handling
    *   Teacher aide and teacher user stories

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Grid Component:** The `Grid` component from Material-UI is causing issues. If the current approach of fixing the props does not work, an alternative may be needed, such as using a different layout component or a custom CSS grid.
*   **Error Handling:** The error handling for API requests needs to be improved to provide more informative feedback to the user.
*   **State Management:** As the application grows, it may be necessary to refactor the Redux store to better organize the state and reducers.
